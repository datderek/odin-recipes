        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
        Guess what time it is! Comfort-food-o’clock. And what makes better comfort food than a rich creamy pasta dish, 
        like this One Pot Beef and Mushroom Stroganoff? This is yet another “better than the box” meal. It cooks in 
        one easy pot, just like hamburger helper stroganoff, but it’s homemade. You’re going to want to tuck this recipe 
        into your back pocket for those nights when you’re super tired and need an extra comforting meal.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp butter</li>
            <li>1/2 lb. ground beef</li>
            <li>8 oz. mushrooms</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp Freshly cracked black pepper</li>
            <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>8 oz. wide egg noodles</li>
            <li>1/3 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp chopped parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mince the garlic. Add the garlic and butter to a large pot or skillet and saute over medium head for about
                one minute, or until the garlic is soft and fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the ground beef and continue to saute until it is fully browned.</li>
            <li>While the beef is browning, slice the mushrooms. Add the sliced mushrooms and some freshly cracked pepper 
                to the pot with the beef. Continue to saute until the mushrooms are soft (about five minutes).</li>
            <li>Add the uncooked egg noodles to the pot along with the beef broth, Worcestershire sauce, and Dijon mustard.
                Stir to combine. The liquid will not fully cover the noodles, but that's okay.</li>
            <li>Place a lit on the pot and allow the liquid to come up to a boil over medium-high heat. As soon as it reaches
                a boil, give the pot a stir, replace the lid, and reduce the heat to low. Allow the pot to simmer on low head 
                for about 7-10 minutes, stirring occasionally and replacing the lid every couple of minutes. After 7-10 
                minutes the pasta should be tender and most of the liquid absorbed.</li>
        </ol>
