        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 Tbsp flaxmeal</li>
            <li>2 & 1/2 Tbsps water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Vegan Oatmeal Cookie Dough</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 & 1/2 cup old-fashioned rolled oats</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vegan butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup soft brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup raisins</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the flax egg, in a small bowl, whish flaxseed meal, and water. Set aside 10 minutes or until a gel-like 
                texture forms.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, stir together flour, oats, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt.</li>
            <li>In another bowl, add softened vegan butter, brown sugar, and sugar. Beat with an electric beater or paddle 
                attachment of a stand mixer until creamy and smooth – about 90 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add flax egg and vanilla extract and stir few seconds until incorporated.</li>
            <li>Stir the dry ingredients into the bowl until a creamy cookie batter forms. Stir in raisins.</li>
            <li>Cover bowl and store cookie dough for 30 minutes in the fridge.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line one or two cookie sheets with parchment paper, and lightly grease with 
                coconut oil or vegan butter. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Scoop out 2 tablespoons of batter, roll between lightly greased hands into a ball, and place onto the prepared 
                cookie sheet. Press them slightly with your hand to flatten.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the remaining cookie dough, leaving some space between each ball as the cookies expand in the oven.</li>
            <li>Bake in the center rack of the oven for 15-18 minutes or until golden brown and crispy on the edges.</li>
            <li>Cool down on the cookie sheet for 10 minutes, they are still soft, hot, and that's normal, they firm up as they 
                cool down. When easy to handle, slide a spatula under each cookie and transfer them to a wire rack before eating.</li>
        </ol>
